# 🎮 Twisteeper

**Minesweeper with a twist!** The board rotates 90° clockwise every 8 clicks, but flagged cells stay frozen in place.

Made for the 2-Day Pausch Challenge 

## 🌟 The Twist

- Board rotates every 8 clicks
- Flagged cells become immovable anchors
- Strategic flag placement is key!

## 🎯 How to Play

1. Left click to reveal cells
2. Right click to place/remove flags
3. Watch the click counter - twist incoming every 8 clicks!
4. Flag strategically to create stable zones
5. Clear all non-mine cells to win

## 🏗️ Development Notes

This was created as part of a 2-day challenge. The core idea was to take the familiar Minesweeper formula and add one meaningful twist that changes the entire strategic landscape.

The "frozen flags" mechanic emerged naturally - if the board is twisting, players need something stable to anchor their strategy around.
