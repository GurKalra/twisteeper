# 🎮 Twisteeper

**Minesweeper with a twist!** The board rotates 90° clockwise every 8 clicks, but flagged cells stay frozen in place.

Made for the 2-Day Pausch Challenge 🏆

## 🌟 The Twist

- Board rotates every 8 clicks
- Flagged cells become immovable anchors
- No flood fill - every click counts
- Strategic flag placement is key!

## 🎯 How to Play

1. Left click to reveal cells
2. Right click to place/remove flags
3. Watch the click counter - twist incoming every 8 clicks!
4. Flag strategically to create stable zones
5. Clear all non-mine cells to win

## 🏗️ Development Notes

This was created as part of a 2-day game jam challenge. The core idea was to take the familiar Minesweeper formula and add one meaningful twist that changes the entire strategic landscape.

The "frozen flags" mechanic emerged naturally - if the board is twisting, players need something stable to anchor their strategy around.
